# Heart-Attack-Prediction
Heart related diseases or Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) are the most reason for an enormous number of death
within the world over the previous couple of decades and has emerged because the most life-threatening disease, 
not only in India but within the whole world. So, there's a requirement of reliable, accurate and feasible system 
to diagnose such diseases in time for correct treatment. Machine Learning techniques and algorithms are applied to 
various medical datasets for analysing largely sophisticated data.Many researchers, in current times, have been the usage 
of countless computing device mastering strategies to assist the health care industry and consequently the authorities within
the prognosis of heart associated diseases. This paper presents a survey of varied models supported such algorithms and techniques
andanalyze their performance. Models are supported by various supervised studying algorithms like K- Nearest Neighbour 
(KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Na√ØveBayes, Random Forest (RF) ,Decision Trees (DT), and ensemble models .
These are found to be very fashionable among the researchers.
